# Summary

Welcome to the beginnings of the mio book. As you can probably tell,
there isn't much here yet. In fact, the docs aren't even available
outside of the git repository yet... (if you are reading this on the mio
site, then this paragraph is out of date and I would appreciate a PR to
fix it).

Before you get started reading more, open up an empty text file. I am
going to ask you to jot down any questions or confusion that you hit as
you read the documentation. Writing clear documentation is hard
(especially for me) as I can't really picture myself learning about mio
from scratch, so if you are confused or have a question that doesn't
seem to be answered, jot it down down as well as where in the docs you
currently are and submit it as an issue on the [mio issue
tracker](https://github.com/carllerche/mio/issues). Also, if you hit any
typos, poor grammer, or confusing passages, please submit issues / PRs
as well.
